     * @brief Start the process of spinning up the independent threads used in
     * the bus attachment, preparing it for action.
     *
     * This method only begins the process of starting the bus. Sending and
     * receiving messages cannot begin until the bus is Connect()ed.
     *
     * In most cases, it is not required to understand the threading model of
     * the bus attachment, with one important exception: The bus attachment may
     * send callbacks to registered listeners using its own internal threads.
     * This means that any time a listener of any kind is used in a program, the
     * implication is that a the overall program is multithreaded, irrespective
     * of whether or not threads are explicitly used.  This, in turn, means that
     * any time shared state is accessed in listener methods, that state must be
     * protected.
     *
     * As soon as Start() is called, clients of a bus attachment with listeners
     * must be prepared to receive callbacks on those listeners in the context
     * of a thread that will be different from the thread running the main
     * program or any other thread in the client.
     *
     * Although intimate knowledge of the details of the threading model are not
     * required to use a bus attachment (beyond the caveat above) we do provide
     * methods on the bus attachment that help users reason about more complex
     * threading situations.  This will apply to situations where clients of the
     * bus attachment are multithreaded and need to interact with the
     * multithreaded bus attachment.  These methods can be especially useful
     * during shutdown, when the two separate threading systems need to be
     * gracefully brought down together.
     *
     * The BusAttachment methods Start(), Stop() and Join() all work together to
     * manage the autonomous activities that can happen in a BusAttachment.
     * These activities are carried out by so-called hardware threads.  POSIX
     * defines functions used to control hardware threads, which it calls
     * pthreads.  Many threading packages use similar constructs.
     *
     * In a threading package, a start method asks the underlying system to
     * arrange for the start of thread execution.  Threads are not necessarily
     * running when the start method returns, but they are being *started*.  Some time later,
     * a thread of execution appears in a thread run function, at which point the
     * thread is considered *running*.  At some later time, executing a stop method asks the
     * underlying system to arrange for a thread to end its execution.  The system
     * typically sends a message to the thread to ask it to stop doing what it is doing.
     * The thread is running until it responds to the stop message, at which time the
     * run method exits and the thread is considered *stopping*.
     *
     * Note that neither of Start() nor Stop() are synchronous in the sense that
     * one has actually accomplished the desired effect upon the return from a
     * call.  Of particular interest is the fact that after a call to Stop(),
     * threads will still be *running* for some non-deterministic time.
     *
     * In order to wait until all of the threads have actually stopped, a
     * blocking call is required.  In threading packages this is typically
     * called join, and our corresponding method is called Join().
     *
     * A Start() method call should be thought of as mapping to a threading
     * package start function.  it causes the activity threads in the
     * BusAttachment to be spun up and gets the attachment ready to do its main
     * job.  As soon as Start() is called, the user should be prepared for one
     * or more of these threads of execution to pop out of the bus attachment
     * and into a listener callback.
     *
     * The Stop() method call should be thought of as mapping to a threading
     * package stop function.  It asks the BusAttachment to begin shutting down
     * its various threads of execution, but does not wait for any threads to exit.
     *
     * A call to the Join() method should be thought of as mapping to a
     * threading package join function call.  It blocks and waits until all of
     * the threads in the BusAttachment have in fact exited their Run functions,
     * gone through the stopping state and have returned their status.  When
     * the Join() method returns, one may be assured that no threads are running
     * in the bus attachment, and therefore there will be no callbacks in
     * progress and no further callbacks will ever come out of a particular
     * instance of a bus attachment.
     *
     * It is important to understand that since Start(), Stop() and Join() map
     * to threads concepts and functions, one should not expect them to clean up
     * any bus attachment state when they are called.  These functions are only
     * present to help in orderly termination of complex threading systems.

     * "ALLJOYN_OBJ" for the sessions management code, "ALLJOYN_BT" for the

     * subsystems override the setting for "ALL" subsystems.  For example if

     * output will be generated for all subsystems except for "ALLJOYN_OBJ"
     * which will only generate high level debug output.  "ALL" defaults to 0
     * which is off, or no debug output.

     *
     *     - 0x1: High level debug prints (these debug printfs are not common)
     *     - 0x2: Normal debug prints (these debug printfs are common)

     *     - 0x8: Data dump (really only used in the "SOCKET" module - can
     *            generate a *lot* of output)
     *
     * Typically, when enabling debug for a subsystem, the level would be set
